## Project: Dog breed recognition

### Project Overview

In this project, given an image of a dog, the deep learning algorithm (Convolutional Neural Network) will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed. A deep learning pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images is built.

### Install

This project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](https://pypi.org/project/scikit-learn/0.16.1/)
- [OpenCV](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/)
- [Keras](https://keras.io/#installation)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)
